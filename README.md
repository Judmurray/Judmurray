- 👋 Hi, I’m @Judmurray
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Analytics and Scientific Computing
- 🌱 I’m currently a graduate of the Computational Modeling and Data Analytics program at Virginia Tech, class of 2023. This program teaches students how to use techniques from upper level Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science in order to gather, structure, manipulate, and analyze data to make meaningful and useful inferences. I am using this page so show some of the programming projects I am working on or have completed in coursework. My github is still a work in progress so I am actively trying to add new material as well as polish my existing Repo's.  
- 💞️ I’m open to collaborating on any and all types of projects and am always eager to learn more!
